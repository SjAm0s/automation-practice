# Automation practice

## Inputs

project-url (required) is the URL of the GitHub project to add issues to. eg: https://github.com/orgs|users/<ownerName>/projects/<projectNumber>
github-token (required) is a personal access token with repo and project scopes.

I had to create a classic PAT token for this to work.
